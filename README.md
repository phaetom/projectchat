# projectchat
Project for UT course

Goals of the project : 

The purpose of our project is to develop a chat program with encrypted communications using paramiko library for Python. 
Paramiko implements the SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. 
The chat program will include development of the functioning GUI, ability to view other participants in the chat, server side handling.
Purpose is to show that secure communications can be developed for personal use that is shared between specific persons. During this project we will develop skills in Python network functionalities & GUI
